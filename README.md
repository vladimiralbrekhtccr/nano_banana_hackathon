# Repo for Nano Banana Hackathon.

What is Nano Banana? 
It's model gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview, a powerful new model for image editing.


# Info about best practices:

8) Best Practices and prompting tips for Nano Banana
To achieve the best results with Nano Banana, follow these prompting guidelines:

Be Hyper-Specific: The more detail you provide about subjects, colors, lighting, and composition, the more control you have over the output.
Provide Context and Intent: Explain the purpose or desired mood of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence its creative choices.
Iterate and Refine: Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use the model's conversational ability to make incremental changes and refine your image.
Use Step-by-Step Instructions: For complex scenes, break your prompt into a series of clear, sequential instructions.
Use Positive Framing: Instead of negative prompts like "no cars," describe the desired scene positively: "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."
Control the Camera: Use photographic and cinematic terms to direct the composition, such as "wide-angle shot", "macro shot", or "low-angle perspective".


## Description of the Hackathon:
### 1
The Challenge: Your mission is to build a product, application, or demo that showcases one or more of these core strengths. Think beyond simple text-to-image. How can these advanced features create a magical user experience?

Consider applications that:

- Enhance dynamic storytelling (e.g., consistent character comics).
- Revolutionize e-commerce (e.g., virtual room placement or product visualization).
- Automate creative workflows (e.g., personalized marketing assets at scale).
- Build the next generation of natural language photo editors.

Evaluation
Show, Don't Just Tell. Your project will be judged primarily on your video demo. This is your chance to create something exciting and compelling. We want to see the "wow" factor, the utility of your application, and the technical skill behind it.

Submission Requirements:
Your complete submission via the Kaggle platform must include the following:

1) The Video Demo (2 minutes or less): An engaging video demonstrating your project in action. It must be posted publicly (YouTube, X/Twitter, etc.) and a direct link provided. It must be viewable by the judges without requiring a login.

2) Public Project Link: A URL to your working product or interactive demo. Consider using AI Studio apps, which are the fastest way to build prototypes using the Gemini API. This allows judges to experience your project firsthand, if applicable. It should be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall. If a live demo is not feasible, a link to your public code repository (e.g., GitHub) is required, including detailed setup instructions.

3) Gemini Integration Writeup: A brief write-up (max 200 words) detailing which Gemini 2.5 Flash Image features were used and how they are central to the application.

Judging Criteria:
Innovation and "Wow" Factor (40%): How creative and novel is the application? Does it leverage Gemini 2.5 Flash Image in a way that wasn't previously possible?

Technical Execution and Functionality (30%): Does the application work? How effectively does it utilize the API's advanced features (consistency, fusion, editing)?

Potential Impact and Utility (20%): Does the application solve a real-world problem (creative, commercial, or educational)?

Presentation Quality (10%): Clarity, storytelling, and engagement of the video demo.
